# Project: Handshakr

Handshakr provides users the ability to create and validate handshake agreements using end-to-end encryption. 
The system incorporates notaries for additional verification and relies on a decentralized approach with Bluetooth data transfer for local transactions.

This is the web interface Frontend Component of Handshakr App.
